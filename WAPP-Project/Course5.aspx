        <p>Let’s go over how to say two important and common words in Korean, “also” and “again.”
        “Also” can be either “도” or “또한,” and “again” can be either “또” or “다시.” I’ll explain how
        each one of them can be used.</p>

        <br />

        <h3>Also<br />도 / 또한</h3>

        <br />

        <p>Both “도” and “또한” can be used to express “also,” but each in different ways.</p>

        <br />

        <p>“도” is used to mean “also” when it’s <b>attached to the end of a noun</b>. In this way, it has the
        meaning of “also” (as in “I <b>also</b> like kimchi”), but it additionally means “even” (as in “<b>Even</b>
        you can speak Korean”) and “too” (as in “me <b>too</b>”)</p>

        <br />

        <p>저<b>도</b> 김치를 좋아해요.<br />
            “I like kimchi <u>too</u>.” or “I like kimchi <u>also</u>.”<br />
            Notice that using “도” replaces the topic marker or the subject marker (or the object marker).
            Without using “도” here, this sentence could begin with “저는 or “제가.”
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>그 사람<b>도</b> 가게에 갔어요.<br />
            “He went to the store <u>also</u>.” or “He went to the store <u>too</u>.”
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>저는 요리하기<b>도</b> 합니다.<br />
            “I <u>even</u> cook.” or “I cook <u>too</u>.” or “I cook <u>also</u>.”<br />
            The verb “요리하다,” “to cook,” can change to become “요리하기,” which means “cooking.”
            For a full lesson on verb nominalization (changing verbs into nouns, such as in this example),
            check out Episode 10.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>“도” always comes <b>after</b> the noun it refers to, and never before it.</p>

        <br />

        <p>“또한” means “also,” and can also translate as “furthermore,” or “in addition.”
            <b>It can be used
            at the start or in the middle of a sentence.</b>
        </p>

        <br />

        <p><b>또한</b> 저는 미국 사람이에요.<br />
            “<u>Furthermore</u>, I am an American.” or “In <u>addition</u>, I am an American.” or “<u>Also</u>, I am an
            American.”
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>그 것 <b>또한</b> 아름답다.<br />
            “That is <u>also</u> beautiful.” or “In <u>addition</u>, that is beautiful.” or “<u>Furthermore</u>, that is beautiful.”
        </p>

        <br />

        <h3>Again<br />또 / 다시</h3>

        <br />

        <p>“또” and “다시” both translate to “again,” but are used in different ways.</p>

        <br />

        <p>“또” means “again,” and has a literal meaning similar to “또한” (“also”); but the difference is
        this: <b>“또” is used as an adverb</b>. In addition, “또” has a slight negative connotation to it – it
        is often used when someone is complaining about something, or when someone feels
        embarrassed (e.g. “Oh no, I can’t believe it happened <i>again</i>.”)</p>

        <br />

        <p>그는 <b>또</b> 약속에 늦었어요.<br />
            “He was late to the appointment <u>again</u>.”
        </p>

        <br />

        <p><b>또</b> 왔네요!<br />
            “You came <u>again</u>!”<br />
            Although “또” is often used in negative situations, it can also be used when speaking
            sarcastically or in a friendly tone. This sentence could therefore either sound quite friendly,
            or rude; this depends on the relationship between the speaker and the listener – you know
            when your friend is joking or not.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>“다시” is used when you want to express “again,” but don’t want to convey any sort of
        negative feeling. <b>“다시” is also used as an adverb.</b></p>

        <br />

        <p><b>다시</b> 한번 만날까요?<br />
            “Should we meet <u>again</u> once more?”<br />
            “한번” means “one time” or “once.”
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>그녀는 <b>다시</b> 그에게 뽀뽀했다.<br />
            “She kissed him <u>again</u>.”<br />
            “뽀뽀하다” means “to kiss,” as in a light kiss (not making out).
        </p>

        <br />

        <h3>또다시</h3>

        <br />

        <p>There’s one more way to say “again,” and that is with “또다시.” As it appears, “또다시” is a
        combination of both “또” and “다시.” Its meaning has more emphasis (it sounds stronger)
        than using either of them individually. Like “또” and “다시,” <b>“또다시” is also used as an
        adverb</b>. “또다시,” like “또,” also has a negative connotation.</p>

        <br />

        <p>“또다시” can also be translated as “ever again” and can be used when telling someone not
        to do something. <b>If you’re not certain how to use “또다시,” just use “또” or “다시”</b> since
        “또다시” is not used in all of the same situations as “또” and “다시.” But it’s important to
        recognize it and know what it means.</p>

        <br />

        <p><b>또다시</b> 여기에 오지 마세요.<br />
            “Don’t come here <u>ever again</u>.”
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>I hope that you’ll be able to use “도” and “또한,” as well as “또” and “다시” in your Korean
        sentences more often. I recommend that you practice these words by making sentences of
        your own. Good luck in your Korean studies!</p>
