        <p>Korean has two ways to say “already” – “이미” and “벌써.” They’re a little different, but the
        difference is pretty simple.</p>

        <br />

        <h3>Already<br />이미 / 벌써</h3>

        <br />

        <p>“이미” is the <b>regular way</b> to express “already.”</p>

        <br />

        <p>“벌써” means “already,” but it also <b> expresses surprise or shock.</b></p>

        <br />

        <p>So whenever you want to express surprise or shock, use “벌써,” and for all other times use
        “이미.” It’s simple, right?</p>

        <br />

        <p>나는 <b>이미</b> 숙제를 했어.<br />
            “I <u>already</u> did the homework.”
        </p>

        <br />

        <p><b>이미</b> 시작했어요.<br />
            “It <u>already</u> started.”
        </p>

        <br />

        <p><b>벌써</b> 시작했어요.<br />
            “It <u>already</u> started.” (“… and I’m <b>surprised</b> that it did!”)
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>첫 사랑을 찾았지만 <b>이미</b> 결혼한 뒤였다.<br />
            “I found my first love, but it was after <u>already</u> getting married.”<br />
            “첫” is an adjective that attaches before nouns to mean “(the) first.”
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>그분은 <b>벌써</b> 나가셨어요.<br />
            “He <u>already</u> left.” (“… and I’m <b>surprised</b> that he did!”)<br />
            “그분” means “that person,” and is a polite way to refer to someone who you are not
            directly speaking with.<br />
            “나가셨어요” is the past tense of the verb “나가시다,” an extra polite way of saying “나가다.”
        </p>

        <br />

        <p><b>벌써</b> 끝났어?<br />
            “Is it finished <u>already</u>?”<br />
            Since this sentence is lacking a “요” at the end, it is informal and for casual use only.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p><b>벌써</b> 졸업할 때가 되었다.<br />
            “It’s <u>already</u> time to graduate.”<br />
            “졸업하다” means “to graduate.”<br />
            This sentence literally means “Already it became the time to graduate.”
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>That’s all for this lesson. As always, I recommend that you practice making your own
        sentences using “이미” and “벌써” in order to get a good feeling for how to use them in
        regular speech. Good luck in your Korean studies!</p>
